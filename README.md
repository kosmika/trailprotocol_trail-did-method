## What is TRAIL?

TRAIL (Trust Registry for AI Identity Layer) is an open cryptographic trust protocol for AI systems and autonomous agents operating in B2B commerce environments.

As AI agents increasingly act on behalf of organizations — negotiating contracts, providing advice, executing decisions — there is no infrastructure to answer the fundamental question: **"Can I trust this AI system?"**

TRAIL solves this by providing:
- **Decentralized Identifiers** (`did:trail`) for AI systems and the organizations behind them
- **Verifiable Credentials** attesting to AI identity, policy, and behavior standards
- **Revocation mechanisms** that create real economic consequences for misuse
- **EU AI Act compliance** alignment by design (Articles 13, 14, 26)

**TRAIL is not a blockchain.** It builds on established web infrastructure (W3C DID Core 1.0, VC 2.0, Ed25519) — the same standards that underpin Europe's eIDAS 2.0 digital identity infrastructure.

## Quick Example

```
did:trail:org:acme-corp-eu
did:trail:agent:acme-corp-eu-sales-assistant-v2
did:trail:self:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK
```

A `did:trail` DID uniquely identifies either:
- An **organization** (`org`) operating AI systems
- A specific **AI agent** (`agent`) operated by a registered organization
- A **self-signed** identity (`self`) for early adopters and testing

## Specification

The full `did:trail` DID Method Specification is available in [`spec/did-method-trail-v1.md`](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md).

Key sections:
- [DID Method Syntax](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md#4-did-method-syntax)
- [DID Document Structure](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md#5-did-document-structure)
- [CRUD Operations](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md#6-method-operations)
- [Trust Extensions](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md#7-trail-trust-extensions)
- [Security Considerations](spec/did-method-trail-v1.md#8-security-considerations)

---

## W3C Registry Submission

The `methods/trail.json` file in this repository is submitted for inclusion in the [W3C DID Specification Registries](https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries).

**Status:** Submission pending (PR to be opened at https://github.com/w3c/did-spec-registries)

## Design Principles

1. **Open Protocol** — The protocol itself is free and open. Trust comes from transparency.
2. **Standards-based** — Built on W3C DID Core 1.0, VC 2.0, Ed25519 — no proprietary dependencies.
3. **Regulation-ready** — Designed for EU AI Act (2027) and eIDAS 2.0 compliance.
4. **Complementary, not competitive** — Works alongside OID4VC, did:web, did:key, DIF Universal Resolver.
5. **Self-sovereign entry point** — Start with `did:trail:self:` without any registry. Graduate to full registration when ready.

## Prior Art & Related Work

| Standard | Relationship |
|----------|-------------|
| W3C DID Core 1.0 | Foundation — did:trail IS a DID method |
| W3C VC 2.0 | TRAIL issues VCs conforming to this standard |
| OpenID4VC (OID4VC) | Complementary — OID4VC handles credential exchange; TRAIL provides trust layer |
| eIDAS 2.0 / EUDIW | Future integration target — TRAIL credentials can be embedded in EUDIW-compatible wallets |
| EIP-6551 (Token-Bound Accounts) | Optional on-chain anchoring path |
| EU AI Act (2024/1689) | Regulatory driver — Art. 13, 14, 26 transparency requirements |
